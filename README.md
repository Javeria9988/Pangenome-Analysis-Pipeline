# Pangenome-Analysis-Pipeline

## Overview
This pipeline performs a comprehensive pangenome analysis, starting from genome annotation, through pangenome identification, read simulation, SNP calling, and finally, detecting premature stop codons and addition of gene description. The pipeline leverages various bioinformatics tools, integrated within a Nextflow workflow to streamline the analysis of multiple sequences.

## Pipeline Structure
The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Annotate:** Annotates the input sequences using prokka.
2. **Panaroo:** Identifies core and accessory genes across the annotated genomes and generates relevant outputs.
3. **DWGSIM:** Simulates error-free reads from the input sequences.
4. **Snippy:** Aligns sequences and calls SNPs based on the simulated reads.
5. **Detect Stop Codons:** Identifies premature stop codons from the SNP data using python code.
6. **GeneDescription:** Adds gene product details using python code.

### Usage
### Running the Pipeline
To run the pipeline, use the following command:
nextflow run main.nf -c nextflow.config -resume

### Parameters
params.sequences: Path to the input sequences in .fa format. The default is set to 'sequences/*.fa'.

### Input Data
Sequences: The pipeline expects input sequences in .fa format, located in the directory specified by the params.sequences parameter.

### Output Data
Annotated Genomes: GFF files generated by the annotation step.
Panaroo Outputs: Core and accessory gene information in CSV and FASTA formats.
Simulated Reads: Error-free reads generated by DWGSIM.
SNPs: SNP calling results from Snippy.
Stop Codon Detection: A report detailing any detected premature stop codons in each sample.
GeneDescription: Adds protein details to output files generated in above step.
